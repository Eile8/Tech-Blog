# Tech-Blog

## Description 
This app serves as a blog where users can share their idea, thoughts, and opinion about various topics. Users without an account can only read posts that are available on the website. By creating accounts with valid username and password, users have much more options to participate in this app such as adding new post, comment on other user's posts. This allows an user to interact with other users, almost like a media plateform. Additionally, users can delete or update their own post on their unique page. All the post and comments follow present date and time.
